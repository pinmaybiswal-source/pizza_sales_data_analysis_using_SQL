# pizza_sales_data_analysis_using_SQL
This project analyzes a pizza sales dataset to uncover insights into customer behavior, revenue generation, and product performance. Using SQL queries, the analysis covers basic, intermediate, and advanced levels of business intelligence reporting.
The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in SQL, data modeling, and analytics storytelling by answering real-world business questions such as:
What are the most popular pizzas?
Which pizza sizes drive the most sales?
How does revenue accumulate over time?
What is the contribution of each pizza type to total revenue?
